    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Mission statement: “To offer ethically sourced Indigenous fashion while promoting a First Nations voice and perspective in the industry.”</p>

    <p>Spirit World Creations prides itself on offering quality fashion ethically produced by Canadian employees in their studio in Montreal, Canada. Everything from printing, sewing, and quality control is handled in house. Environmental responsibility is essential to them. Their studio uses <em>Ecopoly</em>, which requires significantly less energy and water use during manufacturing. Their paper waste is recycled in the city, and excess clothing or imperfect garments are donated to inner-city shelters. All of our exceptional garments are carefully hand-designed by Indigenous artist Stacia Goodman from the <strong>We Wai Kai Nation</strong> in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. She incorporates her family crests into the designs such as thunderbirds, wolves, and orcas passed down to her over many generations.</p>

    <h2>Colours made by organic pigments</h2>
    <p>Traditional paints used to be made with <em>salmon roe</em> mixed with other ingredients to achieve different hues:
    <ol>
      <li>Red - made from red ochre</li>
      <li>White - made from shell or bone</li>
      <li>Black - made from charcoal</li>
    </ol>
