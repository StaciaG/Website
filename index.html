    <h2>Colours made by organic pigments</h2>
    <p>Traditonal paints used to be made with salmon roe mixed with other ingredients to achieve different hues:
    <ol>
      <li>Red - made from red ochre</li>
      <li>White - made from shell or bone</li>
      <li>Black - made from charcoal</li>
    </ol>
